🎮 Interactive Experience
1. Geocentrism vs. Heliocentrism Simulation
Switch between and compare two worldviews with a single toggle:

Geocentrism: Earth is fixed at the center, with the Sun and Moon orbiting it.

Heliocentrism: The Sun is at the center, with Earth rotating and orbiting around it.

2. Foucault Pendulum Simulation
Observe the plane of the pendulum's oscillation rotating over time.

Adjust latitude to see how the pendulum behaves in different regions.

Trajectory display feature.
